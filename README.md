# SnakeGameApplication
The Snake Game Application is a project developed using Java Swing, created to enhance my programming skills and explore GUI development. This engaging game allows players to navigate and grow the snake while avoiding obstacles. It serves as a valuable practice tool for learning new concepts in Java and GUI design.
